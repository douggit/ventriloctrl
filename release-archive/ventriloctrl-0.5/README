-6- Getting Started
--------------------------
Use one of the following to check which device your mouse/keyboard/joystick (whatever you want as your PTT [Push-to-Talk] key) is:

# ls -l /dev/input/by-id/
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Aug 22 10:41 usb-1267_0103-event-kbd -> ../event3
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Aug 22 10:41 usb-Logitech_Logitech_Dual_Action-event-joystick -> ../event5
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 6 Aug 22 10:41 usb-Logitech_Logitech_Dual_Action-joystick -> ../js0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Aug 22 10:41 usb-Logitech_USB-PS.2_Optical_Mouse-event-mouse -> ../event2
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Aug 22 10:41 usb-Logitech_USB-PS.2_Optical_Mouse-mouse -> ../mouse0

OR

# cat /proc/bus/input/devices
I: Bus=0003 Vendor=046d Product=c01d Version=0110
N: Name="Logitech USB-PS/2 Optical Mouse"
P: Phys=usb-0000:00:1a.0-1/input0
S: Sysfs=/class/input/input2
U: Uniq=
H: Handlers=mouse0 event2 
B: EV=17
B: KEY=ff0000 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
B: REL=103
B: MSC=10

I want to use my mouse, and since we can only use the "event" device types I will not choose "js0" or "mouse0"-- I want to use "event2."


--------------------------
-7- VentriloCtrl Configuration
--------------------------
If you haven't do so already run:
# make

Now run (replacing "event2" with the device you wish to use):
# ./ventriloctrl /dev/input/event2

What you're seeing is the "Find Key" sub-program, press the key you wish to use for your PTT now, and press Ctrl+C as instructed.

I want to use mouse button 5, so after pushing it I'm given:
./ventriloctrl /dev/input/event2 276

At this point you'll need to execute Ventrilo first, then run the command you were given.

# ./ventriloctrl /dev/input/event2 276

If VentriloCtrl properly detected Ventrilo then it should be running in silent mode now and telling Ventrilo that you pushed the "A" key any time you use your new PTT key.


--------------------------
-8- Ventrilo Configuration
--------------------------
There are a number of things in Wine and Ventrilo that you need to make sure are properly setup at this point:

1) First, check that your audio input (microphone), and your audio output work (speakers) under Linux.

2) Also make sure that both audio input and output work under WINE.

3) Execute Ventrilo, or better yet, use this script (changing paths, sleep time, and parameters as necessary):
#!/bin/bash
cd ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Ventrilo/
WINEDEBUG="-all" wine Ventrilo.exe &
sleep 3
ventriloctrl /dev/input/event2 276

4) Now in Ventrilo (with ventriloctrl running in the background), click on Setup.

5) Make sure to set these things exactly like below:
 * Check: "Use Push To Talk Hotkey ( PTT Mode )"
 * Uncheck: "Use Direct Input to detect Hotkey"
 * Hotkey: "Keyboard: A" (if you are pushing the key that you setup in the Getting Started section, and it is not appearing as "Keyboard: A" then we have a problem)
 * Check: "Use Direct Sound" for "Output device"
 * Uncheck: "Use Direct Sound" for "Input device"

6) Use Ventrilo in all of it's glory!
