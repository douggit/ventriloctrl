Ventriloctrl
-------------
Ventriloctrl is program to send keypresses to Ventrilo client even 
if it is not on top.  


Requirements
------------
Event Device included in kernel
Xorg(Xfree?) development libraries 
Reading rights for event device

Compiling
---------
# make

Installing
----------
Not yet implemented

Running
-------
# ./runctrl.sh

By default it listens /dev/input/event0 for key 86 ('<' in finnish layout) and sends key A to Ventrilo. 

Configuring
------------
If you want change settings edit runctrl.sh

You might want to change the default event device if that is not your keyboard. (Support for mouse etc. is not yet 
implemented)
You can find right device by # cat /proc/bus/input/devices

Find your keyboard and find a line like this  "H: Handlers=kbd event3"
event3 tells you that right value for EVENT_DEVICE variable is /dev/input/event3

You can also change the key that program listens for.

Use findkey utility to get right code for a key.
# ./findkey <device>
Replace <device> with your keyboard device, /dev/input/event3 for example.

Then press the key and you will see something like this.
key 86 state 1
That tells you that key code for the button you just pressed is 86.
 

No rights to read event device?

###########
# WARNING #
###########
This is totally wrong way to do this and don't even try if you are not only user.

Run next as superuser (root)
# chown <your username> /dev/input/eventx
where x is number of right event device.

Using
-----
Go to settings and hotkey. Press the button what you chosen
and you should see A coming there if you did't edit the 
sources.
