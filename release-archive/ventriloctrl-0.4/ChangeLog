v0.4
===
I ended up using xevie as its a slightly better solution.  Other methods are qt, gtk specific and they also have scoping issues.  This should pretty much be global if i am correct.

I didnt not bother updating the findkey file as its trivial to back port and standard ascii should work for key codes.  Note there is no mouse listener!

You will need to install xevie and add an extension to the xorg conf file.

Section "Extensions"
        Option          "XEVIE"                 "enable"
EndSection

I left some hack code in there for trying to regulate the crazy auto repeat as XkbSetDetectableAutoRepeat does not work!  If figure it out please let me know! 

Let me know if you have any questions/ideas.
